## About

"We are Computer Science students and this is our first time designing a web page with a complex front and back-end. We are using the Early European Books dataset to create a web page that allows users to search for books and view the results."

# Bug Notes

* Sorting hundreds of books can take a long time, or even cause the page to crash.
* In Advanced Search, "End Year" should be above the text box, but sometimes shows next to it. This has only been seen in one laptop, the cause of this is unknown.
